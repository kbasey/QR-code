### What I learned

During this project I learned how to properly import the Google Font -- Outfit.

```
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
  ```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to work on making the page responsive for multiple viewports.
